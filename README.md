# **AudioVisualizerVideoGenerator** 🎶🎥

A **Python-based audio and video processing** project using several libraries to perform transformations, equalizations, and conversions. The project includes custom Python scripts and models to handle media manipulation.

## **Description** 📄

This project is designed to handle various media tasks like audio equalization, video conversion, and processing using Python. It supports advanced functionality for transforming and editing audio/video files using a range of libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, and MoviePy.

## **Installation** ⚙️

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage** 🛠️

To start using the scripts for audio and video processing, you can run the Python scripts directly in your terminal or include them in your project.

### Example:

```bash
python convertor.py
```

Ensure your media files are in the proper directory for processing, or adjust the paths in the code accordingly.

## **Features** ✨

- **Audio Equalization**: Customize sound frequencies using `equalizers.py`.
- **Video Conversion**: Convert video formats and handle processing via `convertor.py` and `moviepy`.
- **Model Integration**: Use `model.py` for advanced operations like media classification or transformation.
- **Tooling Support**: Various helper functions available in `tools.py` for media handling.

## **Files Description** 📂

- `convertor.py`: Script to convert video files into different formats and handle basic video processing.
- `equalizers.py`: Contains functions to equalize audio using predefined filters.
- `model.py`: Implements machine learning models or algorithms to classify or transform media.
- `tools.py`: A set of utility functions to support audio and video handling.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the dependencies required for the project.

## **Requirements** 📦

The following libraries are required to run the project (found in the `requirements.txt` file):

- NumPy
- Librosa
- OpenCV-Python
- MoviePy
- FFMPEG
- Pillow 9.5.0
- Soxr
